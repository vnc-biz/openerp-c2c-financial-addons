 'description': """
 The goal of this module is to improve the basic bank statement, help dealing with huge volume of
 reconciliation by providing basic rules to identify the partner of a bank statement line.
 Each bank statement profile can have its own rules to be applied according to a sequence order.

 Some basic rules are provided in this module:

 1) Match from statement line label (based on partner field 'Bank Statement Label')
 2) Match from statement line label (based on partner name)
 3) Match from statement line reference (based on SO number)
 3) Match from statement line reference (based on Invoice number)

 You can easily override this module and add your own rules in your own one. The basic rules only
 fill in  the partner, but you can use them to fill in any value of the line (in the future, we will
 add a rule to automatically match and reconcile the line).

 It adds as well a label on the bank statement line (on which the pre-define rules can match) and
 a char field on the partner called 'Bank Statement Label'. Using the pre-define rules, you will be
 able to match various labels for a partner.

 The reference of the line is always used by the reconciliation process. We're supposed to copy
 there (or write manually) the matching string. This can be: the order Number or an invoice number,
 or anything that will be found in the invoice accounting entry part to make the match.

 You can use it with  our account_advanced_reconcile module to automatize the reconciliation process.
